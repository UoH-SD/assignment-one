Issues/Bugs


1)More than 2 cards can be turned - need to lock board until cards unflipped

2)Same card can be clicked twice, this will be recognised as a match

3)Need to shuffle cards

SCRIPT
    1)lockBoard variable for board locked or not
    will not run flipCard if board locked
    this is set and removed in the unflip(resetBoard) cards function.

    2)to stop same card issue, we will check if firstcard is the same as
    'this'(card clicked) and if so not continue.(in flipCard func)
    this will need to be reset after each turn to allow card to be clicked on 
    new turn (resetBoard function called from unFlipCards)

    3)Each div(card) has an order property assigned to it. A random function is called
    to assign a random number to the order between 1 and 12.
    By putting the whole function in brackets it is run 
    straight after its definition
